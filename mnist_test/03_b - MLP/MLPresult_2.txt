EXERCISE 5: MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON 

trying to load data/train.csv from pickle
no pickle exists. parsing file data/train.csv
loaded data/train.csv
trying to load data/mnist_test.csv from pickle
loaded data/mnist_test.csv
learning from 5000 data points
classifying 10000 data points
cross-validating kernel with 20 groups


MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON

1. Training the classifier:
The accuracy after cross-validation process: 0.5226
Save classifier in pickle:

2. Get predictions using the classifier:
[['7']
 ['6']
 ['1']
 ..., 
 ['4']
 ['8']
 ['6']]
