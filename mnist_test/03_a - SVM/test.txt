trying to load data/strain.csv from pickle
no pickle exists. parsing file data/strain.csv
loaded data/strain.csv
trying to load data/mnist_test.csv from pickle
loaded data/mnist_test.csv
learning from 1499 data points
classifying 10000 data points
cross-validating kernel with 8 groups

1. Training the classifier:


POLYNOMIAL KERNEL
The accuracy after cross-validation process: 0.914594948231
Save classifier in pickle:

2. Get predictions using the classifier:
['7' '2' '1' ..., '4' '5' '6']
('test_polynomial_kernel processed in ', 26.288165807724)
