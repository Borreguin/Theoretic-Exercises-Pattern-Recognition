We adapted the code from:
http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/mlp.html

These python scripts use theano for making the model and the use of the descent gradient using symbolic expressions.

scripts:
-	Ex3.py 		contains our adaptation
-	MLPLib.py	Contains the Multilayer Perceptrom Model using theano
-	logistic_sgd	Definition of logistic_sgd classifier (looks similar to MLP)
